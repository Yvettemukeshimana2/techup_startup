  Hi, I'm Yvette Mukeshimana! I have studied Computer and Software Engineering at level 3. 
  I took a software training at KLab, where I gained valuable skills in software development.
  Additionally, I participated in an embedded training at KLab, where I learned how to code
 Arduino and other components, and how to design and manufacture PCBs.
   
   During my training at KLab, I acquired hands-on experience in building and programming
   electronic devices, which enhanced my understanding of hardware-software integration.
   I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of hardware and software development.
